# How to draw an animated gif in the GridView's row indicator


<p>This sample illustrates a way of drawing an animated gif in the GridView's row indicator. In this sample the gif is drawn only in the focused row handle but this behavior can be easily changed. We created a small helper class allowing us to get animation frames from the gif and draw them as usual images (the Image class).  The Timer's Interval property is used to set the animation speed. The longer the interval, the slower the animation.</p>
